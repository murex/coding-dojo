###Problem Description

####LRU Cache - Continued
Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It should support the following operations: get and set.
get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
set(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.


#Retrospective
1. The problem was interesting and it was nice to write the algorithm beforehand
2. We should solve more problems using the new languages we are learning
3. It was easy to implement the solution as the algorithm was written beforehand
4. I expected to have more Ruby syntax issues
5. It was fun to write the algorithm 
6. Great team collaboration and excitement to make the code works
