###Problem Description: Huffman encoding in Scala

Workshop Description: 
This session will start by a quick introduction to useful Scala functions and paradigm.
We will then explain how does Huffman encoding/decoding works and write its algorithm in Scala. 
To save time, the tests for this session were already written.

#Retrospective	 
1. The Scala presentation and explaining the exercise were helpful and clear
2. It is nice to discover new languages features
3. It was nice to see the how complicated and dirty it gets if we try to use non functional paradigm to implement functional code
4. I liked practicing Scala and it was nice to write clean code
